\label{actualTimeline}

Here bellow is an accurate timeline of the progress of the project. This timeline, taken from the project presentation slides, gives a loose overview of the key tasks carried out during the project's development.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summer 2021}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Started learning about blockchains, IPFS, libp2p, Chord and Kademlia DHTs
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Term 1}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Getting to grip with distributed (decentralised) systems
              \item Learning about Rust and systems/network programming
              \item Reading academic literature on Information Retrieval in unstructured architectures
              \item Completion of the Discovery and Wider discovery modules
              \item Implementation of naive protocols for Known host management, and Persistent storage modules (allowed for testing and experimentation)
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Christmas break}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Implementation of IR using BFS in the Information retrieval module
              \item Switch from Rust to Go
              \item Starting to write up project documentation
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Term 2}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Reading literature on persistence storage on high churn unstructured p2p systems
              \item Implementation of intelligent known host management optimising for diversity
              \item Implementation of persistent storage based on PCG overlay
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

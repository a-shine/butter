\title{Butter - a decentralised application framework}

    \begin{abstract}
        Peer-to-peer (p2p) systems have some interesting properties in regard to scalability and dependability, due to
        their decentralised nature. They address many of the pitfalls of centralised architectures such as cost of
        infrastructure and single points of failure, resulting in fault-tolerant networks that can behave autonomously.
        Many of the current efforts to design peer-to-peer systems use structured elements which improve the performance
        but re-introduce some of the precariousness present in centralised systems. Butter is a peer-to-peer framework
        loosely inspired by other project such as Gnutella, JXTA and libp2p, its goal is to explore what is achievable
        in unstructured p2p networks. Each of the problems in building a p2p middleware corresponds to a module of the
        framework. Peer discovery is handled using a multicast protocol, we introduce a unique approach to known host
        management optimising for diversity and describe the design of the Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal
        and internet discovery module. Finally, we present the overlay design that enables persistent information and
        information retrieval by introducing Peer Content Groups (PCG) and Random Breadth-first search mechanisms
        respectively. An analysis of different decentralised application services is provided arguing the benefits and
        shortfalls of decentralised architectures. The work provides a complete overview of the project, covering all
        aspects including background information, related projects, management challenges, design, testing and
        evaluation of Butter. We describe the technical achievements, give direction as to the next stage of the
        development and conclude that peer-to-peer architectures are particularly well suited for public information
        and communication services but designing these systems can be more complex than their centralised counterparts.\\

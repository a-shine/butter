    abstract = {{On 24 September 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued two judgments further delineating the scope of the right to be forgotten in the context of search engines. In GC and Others (C-136/17), the Court decided that a search engine operator must only verify the lawfulness of its processing of sensitive data ex post, i.e. upon receiving a request for de-referencing. While lowering the level of protection of the right to data protection, this decision has to be understood as an act that brings the processing of sensitive data by search engines out of the grey area caused by the Court’s decision in Google Spain and Google (C-131/12) and into the sphere of legality. In Google v CNIL (C-507/17), the Court had to determine the territorial scope of the right to be forgotten. It established a general rule of EU-wide de-referencing in connection with measures preventing or at least seriously discouraging access to non-EU search results. This leaves space for non-EU States to find their own balance between data protection and freedom of information. Both decisions can be considered a balancing act of the Court in attempting to reconcile the often very diverging rights and interests of the involved subjects, this time mostly at the expense of the right to data protection.}},

    abstract = {The progressive decentralization of web services brought a need for new instruments to support the development of P2P protocols and applications. The only tools available are network or event simulators, which help the development in artificial or extremely controlled environments. They usually provide low-level support with completely unstructured networks. LibP2P is a library that tries to solve all such problems, letting the users easily deploy nodes on the Internet. It also comes with a set of functionalities, to solve the most important problems of P2P networks, such as NAT traversal, peer and content discovery and routing, and much more. In this paper, we employ LibP2P to implement min-bitcoin, a minimal version of the protocol used by the Bitcoin network to exchange the blocks. We evaluate our implementation to assess the applicability of LibP2P in a real-life blockchain scenario. The evaluation uncovers that setting up communication channels is time-consuming, but data transfers are fast. Additionally, LibP2P efficiently manages cases in which nodes are behind a NAT, under VPN, or in geographically distant places.},

    abstract = {As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important. In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful. Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.}

    abstract = {The concept of unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems---setting free from any structural constraints---has put forward an appropriate paradigm for sharing a wide assortment of resources in a distributed-sharing manner efficiently. More importantly, unstructured P2P systems' architecture and concepts have permeated diverse spheres of today's successful and world-famous computer science areas, including NoSQL databases for excellently sharing data. However, pinpointing any given appropriate resource in such massive systems, namely unstructured P2P systems, is a challenging task; the two of the most dispensable rationales behind this proclaim are large scales of such systems and unstructured nature of overlay networks. Finding a decent resource with low response time, low bandwidth consumption, and high success-rate has played a crucial role in both the overall system performance and the functionality of P2P systems. Briefly, an efficacious resource discover mechanism is the lifeblood of any productive P2P system. Given these points, in this study, we present an exhaustive survey on state-of-the-art resource discover mechanisms employed in file-sharing pure unstructured P2P systems; we offer a new resource discover categorization accordingly. Furthermore, we deeply delve into a plethora of resource searching methods and their merits as well as demerits to furnish the paper with an in-depth evaluation.}

    abstract = {We describe a peer-to-peer distributed hash table with provable consistency and performance in a fault-prone environment. Our system routes queries and locates nodes using a novel XOR-based metric topology that simplifies the algorithm and facilitates our proof. The topology has the property that every message exchanged conveys or reinforces useful contact information. The system exploits this information to send parallel, asynchronous query messages that tolerate node failures without imposing timeout delays on users.},

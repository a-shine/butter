     abstract={The concept of unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems---setting free from any structural constraints---has put forward an appropriate paradigm for sharing a wide assortment of resources in a distributed-sharing manner efficiently. More importantly, unstructured P2P systems' architecture and concepts have permeated diverse spheres of today's successful and world-famous computer science areas, including NoSQL databases for excellently sharing data. However, pinpointing any given appropriate resource in such massive systems, namely unstructured P2P systems, is a challenging task; the two of the most dispensable rationales behind this proclaim are large scales of such systems and unstructured nature of overlay networks. Finding a decent resource with low response time, low bandwidth consumption, and high success-rate has played a crucial role in both the overall system performance and the functionality of P2P systems. Briefly, an efficacious resource discover mechanism is the lifeblood of any productive P2P system. Given these points, in this study, we present an exhaustive survey on state-of-the-art resource discover mechanisms employed in file-sharing pure unstructured P2P systems; we offer a new resource discover categorization accordingly. Furthermore, we deeply delve into a plethora of resource searching methods and their merits as well as demerits to furnish the paper with an in-depth evaluation.},

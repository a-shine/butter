# Butter

A decentralised application (dapp) framework

Note:
The project title was 'efficient decentralised network with case studies' - and this resulted in Butter

First and foremost, we have a nice logo - extremely important for any framework :)

## Part 1: Overview

---

### What is Butter?

Butter is a networking stack and framework for building decentralised applications (dapps).

Note:
What does that mean?... What makes it a framework is because it is composed of a collection of modular packages that you
can piece together to handle the networking behaviour of your application You simply define your overlay network (or use
the default one) and describe the processing you want the nodes of your application to do, the rest is handled by the
framework

Note:
In the taxonomy of distributed systems, it lies here... Why unstructured p2p?...

---

### Motivations

- Lack of confidence in cloud services
- Fascinated by the idea of detaching information from infrastructure
- Interested in designing systems that reflect how people deal with information in the real world (i.e. probabilistic
  vs. deterministic)

### Demo

- Building an echo dapp from scratch
- Wiki dapp

The project GitHub page [github.com/a-shine/butter](https://github.com/a-shine/butter) includes examples to look at too!

Note:
Here's one I made earlier...

## Part 2: Getting technical

---

### Introducing the problems

- **Peer discovery** (cold start problem)
- **NAT traversal** (not really a focus currently)
- **Known host management** (allowing everyone to contribute while still maintaining functionality)
- Overlay network for persistent information
    - Fault-tolerant **storage** (high availability)
    - **Information retrieval** (IR)

Note:
The key problems when designing decentralised unstructured peer-to-peer architecture systems...

---

### Butter's approach

---
#### Goal

Efficient and decentralised while not compromising availability

Note:
Reminiscent of the project's title 'efficient decentralised' as well as the motivations
As I improved my knowledge of distributed systems I started to think about the butter through the lens of fault-tolerance

---
#### Core design philosophies

<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;" -->
- Simplicity
- Modularity
- Memory greedy
- Never panic (fault-tolerant)
- Diversity

Note:
First lets consider the way Butter was designed (this will determine how we solve the problems) and how the philosophies align with the goal
Since exploring the academia of distributed systems and fault-tolerance, I think the best way of looking at project is through the lens of fault-tolerant distributed systems particularly in regard to the availability dependability attribute
- Simplicity - needs to make building dapps easy and feel similar to existing backend web frameworks
- Modularity - you can pick and choose which aspects of the framework you want and re-implement others
- Memory greedy - use as much memory as you have been allowed to use - might as well use it
- Never panic - it's a fault-tolerant system to maximise availability, we should avoid nodes failing at all costs
  cause a node in a faulty state is still more valuable to the network than no node at all
- Diversity - Known host diversity (increase probability of information availability and faster retrieval) + spread load 
  across all types of nodes

#### Solutions

| Problem               | Butter's solution            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Discovery             | Multicast                    |
| NAT Traversal         | (Imperfect) Ambassador nodes |
| Known host management | Known host quality cache     |
| Persistent storage    | PCG overlay                  |
| IR                    | Directed BFS                 |

Note:
Bearing these problems in mind (and the design philosophies) we can go about designing a framework to solve them

---

##### Discovery

```pseudocode
Procedure Ping:
  For:
    Send a ping message along a UDP multicast channel
    Wait for a response
    If response:
      Add peer to known peers
    break
  End
```

```pseudocode
Procedure Listen:
  For:
    listen for UDP packets in the multicast range
    If packet:
      If ping:
        Send a response with your node listner socket address
  End
```

---

##### NAT Traversal

These are somewhat centralised
As a user, you can specify if you want your node to be an ambassador (on the condition it is accessible publicly)
If it is an ambassador, all its local known hosts will be aware he is an ambassador, any other publicly available known host will then

Note:
Brush over this...

---

##### Known host management 1

- Known host quality determined by: uptime, available storage and nb. of hosts known
- Intuitively - we want to optimise for nodes with high uptime, lots of available storage that know lots of other nodes
  BUT!
- Diversity
- Edge cases
    - new node joining the network
    - if 3 nodes and all have max node capacity 1

---

##### Known host management 2

- Trivially if you have enough memory to store a new node, just store it (greedy philosophy)
- If you are at capacity, you can see whether the new node would make the list of known hosts more diverse

---

##### Persistent storage 1

- PCG overlay

Note:
Based on a paper by... Needed a way to reason about information more specifically duplicate/redundant information on the
network - groups

---

##### Persistent storage 2

---

##### Persistent storage 3

---

##### Information retrieval

```pseudocode

```

---

## Part 3: How we got here

---

### The path

- Summer 2021 - learning about blockchains, IPFS and libp2p
- Term 1
    - Getting to grip with distributed systems, specifically decentralised (peer-to-peer architecture) systems
    - Learning about Rust and systems/network programming
    - Reading academic literature on Information Retrieval in unstructured distributed architectures
    - Completion of the Discovery and NAT Traversal packages
    - Implementation of trivial Known host management, and Persistent storage packages
- Christmas break
    - Lots more academic literature on IR in distributed systems
    - Implementation of IR using BFS
    - Switch from Rust to Go
    - Starting to write up project documentation
- Term 2
    - Reading literature on fault-tolerance
    - Shift in focus as we start to look at project from a fault-tolerance perspective
    - Reading literature on persistence storage on high churn unstructured p2p systems
    - Implementation of intelligent known host management optimising for diversity
    - Implementation of persistent storage based on PCG overlay
    - Preparing presentation

Throughout weekly meetings with Adam, who's been really helpful and supportive (as well as challenging might I add)

---

### Unforeseen problems

- Development was taking too long
- Not as well suited to asynchronous programming 

Solution: switch from Rust to Go

- Poor quality of papers in peer-to-peer systems
    - Lack of consistent terminology
    - Assumptions
- Lack of papers on unstructured peer-to-peer

Solution: There was an added challenge to the project in formalising a lot
  of the terminology and coming up with new creative solution and protocols to the problems

Note:
<!--Add project management story I.e. found progress to be very slow in rust and wasnâ€™t the right tool for the job so made the decision to switch to go and project improved-->

---

### What's to come...

- Continued development of the project
- Focus on building a testing framework for peer-to-peer systems in Go
- Reviewed scepticism of libp2p

Note:
Having been sceptical of libp2p, I have a much better appreciation for its design, I would like to contribute to it
hopefully working towards a more unstructured architectural design
Do a comparison with libp2p

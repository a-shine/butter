## Background

`butter` is a networking stack and framework for building decentralised applications (dapps). The goal of the project is to design an *efficient decentralised framework* that is as close as possible to being fully decentralised (no single controlling entity or point of failure). The result is a distributed network with an unstructured peer-to-peer architecture.

Please see the full [project documentation](https://a-shine.github.io/butter/) for more information.

**Understanding what is meant by *efficient decentralised framework*:**

- `butter` is *efficient* in the sense that it
  - maintains persistent data consistently (despite node failure and high churn) while trying to minimise data redundancy (low degree of duplicate data)
  - takes a space-efficient approach to creating and maintaining the list known hosts per node (by determining who are the 'best' remote hosts to know are on a node-by-node basis)
- `butter` is *decentralised* in the sense that it is built with an unstructured peer-to-peer architecture
- `butter` is a *framework* in the sense that it provides tooling and utilities (in the form of a library packages and a standard atomic node) as well as documentation and examples for developing dapps

This project should facilitate the development of dapps by abstracting away the distributed behaviour from the developers and accommodate nodes with a whole variety of hardware.

## Usage

### Preamble: communicating over the wider internet
The platform assumes a basic understanding of how to port forward (for home use). This is to deal with the pesky issue of NAT traversal when listening out for incoming connections. Port forwarding is actually very simple but may seem daunting so here is a good [guide](https://portforward.com/router.htm) on how to do it.

The library will either assign or expect the user to provide a port when creating a node. If that node needs to be accessible outside the subnetwork it will be necessary to port forward from the router to the node's assigned/chosen port.

It is worth noting that not every node port needs to be forwarded, all it takes is one node on the LAN to be accessible from the internet for the subnetwork to interact across the internet.

### Installation

1. From within your Go project, run the following command:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/a-shine/butter
   ```
   This will download the library and configure your `go.mod` file.
2. Import the package into your project source:
   ```go
   package main
   import "github.com/a-shine/butter"
   ```

### Working with the framework
Butter is designed to be modular. It provides an inbuilt overlay (implementation of the Overlay interface) called persist (which is what allows for the inbuilt storage and retrieval packages to work) but if you wish to implement your own overlay network that is possible too. You can implement your own version of the Overlay struct.
For ease of use you can use the default overlay network using the `butter.SpawnDefaultOverlay` function. but yu have the lexibiluty to pick and chose what component packahes you would like to use from the frameowkr.

### Examples
Take a look the examples in the [examples/](./examples) directory.

To run one of the included examples, from the root of the project type:
```bash 
go run examples/<example_name>/main.go
(e.g. go run examples/ohce/main.go)
```

#### Non-persistent data (Chat application)
```go
// TODO: Add commented example code
```
#### Persistent data (Wiki application)

**Explaining the project structure**:

Making a functional peer-to-peer system can be broken down into several components:

1. Defining the node behaviour and maintaining the network by managing known hosts (`node/`)
2. Discovery (`discover/`)
3. NAT traversal (`traverse/`)
4. Persistent overlay network (`persist/`)
   1. (Persistent) information storage (`store/`)
   2. (Persistent) information retrieval (`retrieve/`)

These are reflected in the project package structure

### Testing

When testing on a development machine, it may become necessary to test the behaviour across several IP addresses, this can be achieved by running nodes from different containers.
